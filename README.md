<h2>Automated honeypot for email</h2>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Pot Stickers is an email honeypot system intended to bait malicious phishing attempts, contact the domain registrar, and file an ICANN complaint.</p>

<p>This idea started from the frustration and sense of helplessness I had in receiving an incredible anount of spam and junk mail in my inbox.</p>

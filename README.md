<h1>Pot Stickers</h1>
<h2>Automated honeypot for email</h2>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Pot Stickers is an email honeypot system intended to bait malicious phishing attempts, contact the domain registrar, and file an ICANN complaint.</p>

<p>This idea started from the frustration and sense of helplessness I had in receiving an incredible anount of spam and junk mail in my inbox. While having spam domains shut down likely won't halt malicious operations, it will hopefully make them more difficult.</p>

<p>Project timeline:</p>

<li>Hosted web versions</li>
</ul>
